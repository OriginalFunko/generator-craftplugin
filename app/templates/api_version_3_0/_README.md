## Installation

To install <%- pluginName %>, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `<%= pluginDirName %>` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone <%= pluginCloneUrl %>` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require <%= pluginAuthorGithub %>/<%= pluginHandle.replace(/([A-Z])/g, function($1){return "-"+$1.toLowerCase();}).slice(1) %>`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `<%= pluginDirName %>` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.
